# Look at my journey trying to find wine in NYC.https://mandiuu.github.io/Wine/

I was asked what I miss from my country, and I miss being able to get drunk at an average price, unlike in NY. I searched for the cheapest Chilean wine in NYC and realized that there are more expensive here. 

After looking at websites of local stores in the five boroughs, I created a data set with the prices of the 120 Wine https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_IWB5MBY7f44NgogU6-ysxNI--FknJw82DFG-3U3BFs/edit?usp=sharing

Using the data of Global Health Observatory, I collected the data of the countries in America to compare the wine consumption per year https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dVho_gYn0vWjWCID7KIYugtxBUFeXPIAowMGPpWqjLc/edit?usp=sharing

I use R and ggplot to show the prices of 120 wine in NYC, and also use Datawrapper for the charts. In the future I'll like to upgrade the ggplot and also display an interactive section where people can choose a wine and it shows how to pair it with food.
